# How to open Bitfocus Companion
If Bitfocus Companion is not setup to startup at login, follow the below instructions to start the Bitfocus Companion application.

**Note**: These instructions were created using a Windows 10 machine, but the steps should be similar no matter what Operating System you are using.

1. Open the **Search** bar

2. Search for **"companion"**

3. Click on the **Companion App** (when the application loads, you should see the following screen)

You should also be able to confirm that the application is running in your toolbar.

By now, whatever Elgato Stream Deck you have attached to the machine running Bitfocus Companion should show whatever configuration has been setup previously. Now with Bitfocus Companion open, you can also setup the application to start at login so that you will not need these steps again. :wink: To enable this feature, click the checkbox titled **Run at login**

It is also a good suggestion to create a desktop or taskbar icon for quickly launching the application.
